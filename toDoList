I'm in too deep! I love this project and have learned so much about what not to do, which is why I need it to be over ;)
But a wise man once said, it ain't over till the fat lady sings!
Fix-
-Line Snap for opposite side of symmetry
-potential DOM Bugs, like buttons not disappearing or reappearing (last thing to do I'm thinking)
-alter the minimum and maximum grid size to feel better
-Take into account alternate screen sizes (this def wont be responsive but what will happen with a tiny screen? a super big screen?

Add-
- temp array for inital addition of points to get rid of "can't find worldX" etc.
-delete button.
-reference image upload
-final source code text download
-potentially a file save/download and open up again in the browser option.
-hotkeys (this is gonna be fun and add alot of usability)

if i had more TIME or maybe in acouple months:
Scale
Rotate
