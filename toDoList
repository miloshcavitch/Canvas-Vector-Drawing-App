I'm in too deep! I love this project and have learned so much about what not to do, which is why I need it to be over ;)
But a wise man once said, it ain't over till the fat lady sings!
Fix-
-Grid Snap
-Line Snap for opposite side of symmetry
-potential DOM Bugs, like buttons not disappearing or reappearing (last thing to do I'm thinking)
-alter the minimum and maximum grid size to feel better
-Take into account alternate screen sizes (this def wont be responsive but what will happen with a tiny screen? a super big screen?

Add-
-Circle creation
-(Poly)line creation
-Pixel Creation- gotta be good.
-Convert Polygons and polyShapes into bezier curved objects (gonna be fun)
-hotkeys (this is gonna be fun and add alot of usability)
(sounds like alot but I'm more worried about fixing the existing stuff)

if I had more time I'd love to add a shift click/multi-select ability but that would change every single dam function, so kind of impossible. If I started this
from scratch it would be a hella smooth program but like I said before, aint nobody got time for that!

But once this program is finished I think it has the potential to be a very popular program on the interwebs, def filling an unfilled hole.
IDK how many people need that hole tho!
